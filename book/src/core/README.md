# Layer 1 - Core

Layer 1 provides primitives for interacting with LLMs and composing messages, tools, and structured outputs.

## Components
- Messages: typed containers for role + content.
- Completion Config: tuning parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.).
- Tools: callable functions surfaced to the LLM.
- Gateway: abstraction over model providers.
