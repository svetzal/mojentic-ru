# Mojentic for Rust

Mojentic is an agentic framework with an asynchronous pub/sub architecture designed to orchestrate LLM-powered agents. This Rust crate focuses on high performance, strong typing, and reliability.

- Fast, async-first event processing
- Agents compose into complex systems
- Clear separation between Core (LLM primitives) and Agents (behaviors)

If you’re familiar with the Python project, this book mirrors its structure and concepts, adapted to Rust idioms.
